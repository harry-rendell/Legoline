We have Code\GUI\Legoline_User_Interface()
and it has two call back methods for two types of experiments:
Feed_Rate_Experiment_Callback
Pallet_Buffer_Experiment_Callback
it also automatically greys out button based on data file but I do not need to worry about that for  now
what those two fuctions do are simply invoking Feed_Rate_Experiment.m and Pallet_Buffer_Experiment.m
These two methods invoke the initialise, start, finish.
initialise open up all the matlab instances
